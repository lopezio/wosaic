# Wosaic #

Ever wondered what you could do with all the hundreds of digital pictures that you've accumulated?  Why not make a mosaic?

Wosaic is an open source project that allows you to recreate an existing image by using many smaller images, as shown above.  It was started as a project for CS 242 - Programming Studio at UIUC, and will be continuing on to Engineering Open House in the Spring of 2008.

Wosaic is not the only program of its kind.  Several other solutions already exist, however Wosaic aims to be free, easy to use, fast, and accessible.  These qualities are yet to be found in any single existing solution.  We're also aiming to make use of interesting sources for images.  Currently, we support Flickr, Facebook, and local sources, but we hope to expand this to possibly include images from Picassa, and hopefully other sources as well.

## Features ##

  * Easily create a mosaic out of an image on your disk
  * Utilizes Flickr, Facebook, and local directories for images
  * Supports concurrency to provide fast results
  * Shows progress by constructing the mosaic right before your eyes!
  * Programmed in Java
  * It is FREE and released under the GNU GPL v2.
