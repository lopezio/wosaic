# General Notes #

This meeting was generally to finalize things after EOH, and create new release files.  We put out our email from the mailing list we gathered at EOH, and we also worked on projected "Milestones" for the next release.  We've added many bug reports and such, so see the [issues](http://code.google.com/p/wosaic/issues/list) page for details.

We are projecting our next release for around April 17th.

## Goals ##

  * Take a break.
  * Start working on Milestone'd issues after Spring Break.
