UI Design

---



Simple image utilities: zoom, crop
Screen real-estate
> - Collapsable left-hand pane
> - GTK for cross platform UI dev

Tile roll-over: enhance image
> - Have a fixed section of screen devoted to preview
> - Have a pop-up preview in a floating pane
> - Have a preview in the options tab
Wosaic pane should be more self-aware

Save dialog should prompt for dimensions


Play around with algorithms
> - Implement buckets
> - Different metrics?
> > - Intensity
> > - Hue/Saturation distance
> > - Shape matching with grayscale and tinting

Think about redesign/C++ stuff

Look into threading options

Cache for tile/images

> - Cache images on local file space
