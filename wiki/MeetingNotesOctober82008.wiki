UI Design
---------


Simple image utilities: zoom, crop
Screen real-estate
  - Collapsable left-hand pane 
  - GTK for cross platform UI dev

Tile roll-over: enhance image
  - Have a fixed section of screen devoted to preview
  - Have a pop-up preview in a floating pane
  - Have a preview in the options tab
Wosaic pane should be more self-aware

Save dialog should prompt for dimensions


Play around with algorithms
  - Implement buckets
  - Different metrics?
     - Intensity
     - Hue/Saturation distance
     - Shape matching with grayscale and tinting

Think about redesign/C++ stuff

Look into threading options

Cache for tile/images
  - Cache images on local file space
